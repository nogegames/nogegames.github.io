Hi! I'm Noge, a solo videogame developer from Spain.

I'm currently developing full-time just by myself, and I'm still far away from earning enough to sustain myself... But I'm trying!

In december 2021 I published my first independent game for Android: [Hanafuda Koi-koi Dojo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Noge.HanafudaKoikoi). In the game you can learn how to play koi-koi with hanafuda cards, a classic japanese game. Complete the adventure mode and compete aganist other players in the online mode!

Right now I have a few projects in development while still making improvements to the Hanafuda game, if you want to contact me or know more, feel free to check my socials:
